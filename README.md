### Have you ever wounderd to learnimage segmentation using pytorch ? your in right pleace! You can learn image segmentation with your custom dataset using pytorch and learn new things about pytorch in this repo 
####  This a good project that I created it using this official [toturial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html) from pytorch.
#### In this project we're going to create a medical mask segmentation.

This project is  :
* Great for learning Image segmentation using pytorch 🔥
* Great for learning functions in pytorch related to image segmentation 💪
* Great for learning new things in pytorch ⚡
* Great for learning transfer learning and using pre-trained models for image segmentation 🤖
* Great for training you own image segmentation model and use it in other projects ✨
